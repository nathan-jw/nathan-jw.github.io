        <h5>Why Computer Engineering?</h5>
        <p>
          I've been intrigued by electronics and machines for as long as I remember. As a kid, I used to take any old
          electronics—cheap motorized toys, broken phones, old hard drives, or whatever else eight-year-old me could
          get my hands on—and break them open in the backyard. I would stare at the circuits inside, wondering, "how?"
          Nowadays, designing PCB circuits myself, I feel the same sense of wonder. Even the simplest technology is
          incredibly complex under the hood, and the closer you look, the more there is to discover. I'm constantly
          surprised by just how much there is to learn and how little I actually know.

        <h5>Other Hobbies</h5>
        <p>
          I have many hobbies outside of engineering and other nerd stuff. I'm a huge fan of music (124,000 minutes on
          my last Spotify wrapped), enjoy cooking for myself and my family, and love to read. In addition to these, my
          favorite hobbies more artistic: writing and photography. I enjoy having creative outlets both through my
          technical and artistic interest, and love blending the two. I have a particular interest in creative image
          processing and enjoy putting my programming skills to use making interesting and novel filters and effects to
          apply to the photos I take.

          <p>
            PCB board I'm making as a part of the RoboSub UTD GalaxSea electrical team. This board takes a 14.4V input
            and feeds it out to a Jetson Orin NX and lidar sensor. It also uses an on-board 14.4V to 12V buck converter to
            deliver power to ten seperate JST connectors where various motors and other components can be powered.

          <p>
            Dohyo is a work-in-progress 2D sumo robot simulator written in C. Inspired by
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/artfulbytes/bots2d" target="_blank">Bot2D</a>, the goal is to create
            a cross-platform simulator realistic and versatile enough for code written for the simulator to be able
            to be used on a physical robot with minimal changes.

          <h5><a class="link" href="https://github.com/RoboSub-UTD/attendance-tracker" target="_blank">Club Attendance Tracker</a></h5>
          <p>
            Website made using SvelteKit and Node.js to help track member attendance for RoboSub UTD. The website presents
            a log-in screen to user where they swipe their university ID card through a reader, parsing the information and
            validating their identity. In the case that the member has not signed in through the system before, a screen is presented
            prompting them to insert their full name, public university ID, and any projects within the club that they
            are involved in, which is inserted into a database. Upon future swipes, it automatically validates the
            information on their university ID card against the information in the database, counting them present
            with a simple card swipe.
